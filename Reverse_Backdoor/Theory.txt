What is a Reverse Backdoor?

    A reverse backdoor is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control
    a victim's computer or network, bypassing traditional security mechanisms.

    How It Works:

    Initial Infection:
        The attacker places a malicious program (backdoor) on the victim’s machine.
        This could be done through phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or other means.

    Connection to Attacker: Once installed, the backdoor opens a communication channel
        (usually over the internet) from the victim's machine to a remote server controlled by
        the attacker.

    Remote Access: The attacker can now remotely access the system, perform operations like
        stealing data, installing additional malware, or taking control of the system.

    Reverse Aspect: Unlike a traditional backdoor that waits for the attacker to connect to it,
        a reverse backdoor forces the infected machine to initiate the connection to the attacker’s
        server, making it harder for defenders to detect.
    
    Key Points:
        Bypasses Firewalls/Intrusion Detection: The victim’s machine connects to the attacker’s server,
        which may bypass firewall rules.

        Stealth: The attacker doesn’t need to directly interact with the victim’s machine,
        making it harder to trace.

        Remote Control: Provides full control to the attacker, often without the victim’s knowledge.
    
    Common Uses:
        Data theft
        System manipulation
        Surveillance
        Deployment of additional malware

    In short, a reverse backdoor is a stealthy, remote access tool that opens a pathway
    for attackers to control a system from the inside out.
