        Goal -< Discover clients on network 

        Steps:
            1. Create arp request directed to broadcast MAC asking for IP.
                Use ARP to ask who has target IP.
                Set destination MAC to broadcast MAC.

            2. Send packet and receive response.
            3. Parse the response.
            4. Print result.

        Lists:
            List of values/elements, all can be stored in one variable.
            Ex:
                lucky_numbers = [3,7,8,17,24]
                Python will interpret this as 

                index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
                value | 3 | 7 | 8 | 17| 24|

            Elements can be accessed using their index 
                print(lucky_numbers[0]) # prints 3 
        
        Dictionaries:

            Similar to lists but use key instead of index.

            Ex:
                target_client = {"mac":"00:11:22:33:44:55, "ip":"10.0.2.1", "os":"windows"}
            Python will interpret this as 

            Key         mac                 ip          os 
            values   00:11:22:33:44:55    10.0.2.1    windows 

            Elements can be accessed using their key 
            print(target_client["mac"]) #prints 00:11:22:33:44:55
            print(target_client["ip"]) #10.0.2.1
            print(target_client["os]) #windows
