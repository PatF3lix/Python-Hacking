ARPSpoof_Detector

    - Watch values for gateway mac in the arp table 
        - Nice and simple, but will not detect an attack if the tool is executed after the attack 
    
    - Analyse "is-at" ARP response 
        - Check if IP is gateway ip.
        - Check if source mac is actually the gateway's mac 
        - This method will detect attacks even if the attack was launched before the execution of the tool
