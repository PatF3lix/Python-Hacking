Packaging for Windows from Linux 

    - For best results package the program from the same OS as the target.
        - EG if target is Windows then package the program from a Windows
            computer with a python interpreter
        
        - Install Windows python interpreter on Linux
        - Use it to convert python programs to Windows executables
