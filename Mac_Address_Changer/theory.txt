Why change the MAC address ?

    Because this is a physical, unique address to each interface, to each network device, and Because
    it is used to identify devices, then changing it will make you anonymous on the network.

    Not only that, but mac address is often used by filters to prevent or allow devices to connect to networks and do specific tasks on the network.
    Being able to change your mac address to another devices mac address will allow to impersonate this device.

    1. Increase anonymity
    2. Impersonate other devices
    3. Bypass filters

        Using a module to execute system commands 

        the subprocess module contains a number of functions.
        these functions allow us to execute system commands.
        commands depend on the OS which executes the scripts.

        Syntax
            import subprocess
            subprocess.call("COMMAND", Shell=True)
    
    Handling User Input

        Easiest way of getting user input is through keyboard 
        input() function prompts the user to enter a value

            ex: age = input("What is your age ?")
    
    Handling command line arguments

        import optparse

        parser = optparse.OptionParser()

        parser.add_option("-i", "--interface", dest="interface", help="Interface to change its MAC address")
        parser.add_option("-m", "--mac", dest="new_mac", help="new MAC address")

        (options, arguments) = parser.parse_args()
        command = "ifconfig"

        # print(options.interface + " " + options.new_mac)

        subprocess.call([command, options.interface, "down"])

        ex: sudo python mac_changer -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
    
    Functions 

        set of instructions to carry out a task
        can take input and return results
        make the code clearer reusable and more abstract

        ex: 
            def function_nam(var1, var2, etc..)
    
    If/else conditions 

        1-if/else 

            if parser.interface:
                code
            else 
                code
        2-if/elif/else
            if parser.interface:
                code
            elif parser.new_mac:
                code
            or with else:
                code
        3-if/if
            if parser.interface:
                code
            if parser.new_mac:
                code
            rest of code...

    Regular Expressions 

        Search for specific patterns within a string
        Uses rules to match patterns

        Great to tell a progrram what to look for in a large text.
