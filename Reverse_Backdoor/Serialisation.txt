Backdoors Sockets 

    Problem 
        - TCP is stream based
        - Difficult to identify the end of the message/batch
    
    Solution:
        - Make sure the message is well defined.
        - Implement a protocol that send and receive methods conform to.
            - Send size of message as header.
            - Append a end-of-message mark to the end of each message.
            - Serialize the message 
    
    Benefits:
        1. Message is well defined, receiver knows if message is incomplete 
        2. Can be used to transfer objects (lists, dicts..etc)
    

            Server                  <---------------        Client
    Converts well-defined stream                        Converts object to a stream
    of bytes back into an object.                       of well-defined bytes.

    Serialization
        - Json and Pickle are common solutions
        - Json (Javascript Object Notation) is implemented in many prog. languages
        - Represents objects as text.
        - Widely used when transferring data between clients and servers.
