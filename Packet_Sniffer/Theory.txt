Packet Sniffer 
    Capture data flowing through an interface 
    Filter this data 
    Display interesting information such as:
        Login info (username & passwords).
        Visited websites
        Images 
        etc..
    
    - Scappy has a sniffer function 
    - Can capture data sent to/from iface 
    - Can call a function specified in prn on each packet.

    Syntax: 
        import scappy.all as scappy 
        scappy.sniff(iface=[interface], prn=[call back function])

    how to extract the raw data
    ChatGPT said:

    To extract the raw data from a sniffed packet in your code,
    you can access the raw bytes of the packet using packet.load.
    This attribute contains the raw payload of the packet,
    including all layers above the network layer (such as HTTP headers, body, etc.).

    Here’s how you can modify your process_sniffed_packet function to extract and print the raw data:

    import scapy.all as scapy
    from scapy.layers import http

    def sniff(interface):
        scapy.sniff(iface=interface, store=False, prn=process_sniffed_packet, filter="")

    def process_sniffed_packet(packet):
        if packet.haslayer(http.HTTPRequest):
            # Extract and print the raw data (the load field contains the payload)
            raw_data = packet.load
            print("Raw Data:\n", raw_data)

    # Example usage
    # sniff("eth0")  # specify the network interface you want to sniff on

    Explanation:

        packet.load: This contains the raw byte data of the packet.
        packet.haslayer(http.HTTPRequest): This checks if the packet contains an HTTP request, and if so, the raw data from the payload is extracted.

    You can then analyze or print the raw data.
    If you're interested in specific parts of the HTTP request (like headers or body),
    you may need additional parsing, but this will give you access to the entire raw data
    for each HTTP request captured.
